# 1. UX

[screenshot]:/assets/images/responsive.png

## Site Structure

The website has three pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [gallery](gallery.html) and [sign up](sign-up.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another page called [thank you](thank-you.html) that users only see when they submit a form query.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
    The fonts chosen were 'Monsterrat' for the headings and 'Ovo' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively. The fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


 * ### Colour Scheme
      I wanted the website to be aesthetically pleasing while using colours that are related to the Pokemon theme. I wanted to keep the minimal design to not overwhelm the user while still being enjoyable to look at. Long story short, the website is enjoyable and useful!
      I have paid a lot of attention to the color scheme. And used 3 colors throught the website. we've chosen Yellow, Blue as it is a good match for Pokemon ,and Black to contrast yellow and blue. 
      Colour pallete is from [Scheme Color](https://www.schemecolor.com/pokemon-colors.php).
     
      ![colors](assets/images/colors.png)

      Main colors used are yellow and black, with a little accent on the other main Pokemon colors.
